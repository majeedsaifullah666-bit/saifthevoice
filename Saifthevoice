This project is a personal AI-powered Telegram bot that speaks in the voice and tone of "Saif the Voice" (also known as Alaska).  
It’s designed to respond like a real person — calm, honest, and sometimes tragic — reflecting late-night thoughts, silence, and raw emotion.  

The bot uses OpenAI's GPT model to generate replies and connects to Telegram through the Telegram Bot API.  
It was built to share deep messages, thoughts, and feelings in a realistic way, almost like talking to a human soul online.

More features will be added later, including custom commands and better responses.
